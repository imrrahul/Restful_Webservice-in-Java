# Restful_Webservice-in-Java


# I have attempted the assignment with full dedication and completed the following parts sections in the assignment - 

1.  Created a RESTful web service using JISPER in java.
2. The Webservice is able to POST request .
3 . The Webservice is able to GET request .
4. The Webservice is able to - 
     a.) Make the above two RESTful web services secure i.e. only a user who has the necessary Auth token
          should be able to access them (Auth token passed in header)
     b.) The Auth token is obtained by a user by some method of authentication (either of Auth key/Login
           credentials or both) â€“ The creditial is already assigned by me in the coding to verify the clients.
5.) I am unable to store the customer details in the cloud via input taken by user but able to store the data in the cloud via cloud shell/Terminal
6.) Due to this reason I am not able to retrieve customer details using GET method of Webservice.
7.) I am unable to host the application over cloud app engine.
8.) I am posting a github repository link here so that You can verify the code and some results.
9.) I have vefified the security of webservice using POSTMAN app in the chrome webstore to check autheticity of the client.
